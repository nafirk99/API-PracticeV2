1. UploadFile():

This method handles the upload of any type of file.
It receives an IFormFile object representing the uploaded file.
Checks if the file is valid (not null or empty).
Creates a directory to store the uploaded files (wwwroot/uploads) if it doesn't exist.
Saves the uploaded file to the specified directory.
Returns an OK response with information about the uploaded file (filename, size, and relative path).
2. UploadEncodedFile():

This method specifically handles the upload of files (likely PDFs) and encodes them into a Base64 string.
It checks if the file is valid and has a PDF extension (commented out in the provided code).
Saves the uploaded file to the "uploads/encoded" directory.
Reads the file content into a byte array.
Encodes the file content into a Base64 string.
Saves the Base64 encoded string to a text file in the "uploads/encoded" directory.
Returns an OK response.
3. DecodeAndSaveFile():

This method handles the upload of a text file containing Base64-encoded data (likely representing a PDF).
Checks if the file is valid and has a ".txt" extension.
Saves the uploaded text file to the "uploads/decoded" directory.
Reads the Base64-encoded content from the text file.
Decodes the Base64 string back into a byte array.
Saves the decoded byte array as a PDF file in the "uploads/decoded" directory.
Returns an OK response with information about the encoded and decoded files.
4. UploadAndProcessPdf():

This method handles the upload of a PDF file, encodes it to Base64, decodes it back to a PDF, and saves the processed file.
It checks if the file is valid and has a PDF extension.
Saves the uploaded PDF file to a temporary directory.
Reads the PDF file into a byte array.
Encodes the PDF data into a Base64 string.
Decodes the Base64 string back into a byte array.
Saves the decoded PDF file to the "uploads/processed" directory.
Returns an OK response with information about the original and processed files.
In essence, this API controller provides functionalities for:

Uploading and saving files to the server.
Encoding files into Base64 format.
Decoding Base64-encoded files.
Processing files (in this case, encoding and decoding PDFs).
This is a basic example, and you can extend it further to include features like:

File validation and sanitization.
Database storage of file metadata.
Integration with cloud storage services.
More advanced file processing operations.
